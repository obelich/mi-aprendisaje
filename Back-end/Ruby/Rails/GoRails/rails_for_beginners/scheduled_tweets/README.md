# The Model View Controller (MVC Pattern)


## Routes
Matchers for the URL that is requested

GET for "/about"

I see you request "/about", we'll give that to the AboutController to handle

## Models
Database wrapper

User
* query for records
* wrap individual records

## Views

Your response body content

* HTML
* CSV
* PDF
* XML

This is what gets sent back to the browser and displayed

## Controllers

Decide how to process a request and define a response
